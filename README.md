# difference-betwen-thread-and-process-in-windows-and-linux
This is for my "operating system course" project.
I changed "merge sort" code and designed it in thread and process, then run them in windows and linux operating sytems.
So, I could measure difference between "Time duration", "Memory Usage" and "CPU utilization" in various Operating systems.
