# difference-between-thread-and-process-in-windows-and-Linux
This is for my "operating system course" project.
I changed the "merge sort" code and designed it in thread and process, then ran them in Windows and linux operating systems.
So, I could measure the difference between "Time duration", "Memory Usage" and "CPU utilization" in various Operating systems.
